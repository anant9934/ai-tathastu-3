# Deployment

AI Tathastu runs as three pieces:

| Piece | Where | What it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web app | Vercel (`www.aitathastu.com`) | Next.js: onboarding, dashboard, APIs. Deploys on every push to `main`. |
| Worker | Render free Web Service (`https://ai-tathastu.onrender.com`) | `worker/server.py`: resume extraction, connector sync, `compute_intelligence`. Deploys when `worker/**` changes (`render.yaml`). |
| Database | Neon Postgres | Shared by both. Migrations are applied by hand (below), never on deploy. |

Uploaded resumes go straight from the browser to Cloudflare R2.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck, lint, Vitest, the Playwright E2E and the worker tests on every push and PR to `main`. It needs no secrets.

---

## Environment variables

Never commit real values. `.env*` is gitignored except `.env.example`, which is the template.

### Vercel (web app)

Settings → Environment Variables, Production. Mark secrets as Sensitive.

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Neon **pooled** URL (host contains `-pooler`), `?sslmode=require`. |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | `openssl rand -base64 33`. Rotating it signs everyone out. |
| `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` | No | `true`. Vercel sets the host itself; harmless to keep. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | For Google sign-in | Redirect URI `https://www.aitathastu.com/api/auth/callback/google`. The button is hidden when unset. |
| `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID`, `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` | For LinkedIn sign-in | OIDC app. Redirect URI `https://www.aitathastu.com/api/auth/callback/linkedin`. |
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT` | Yes (email) | `smtp.gmail.com`, `465`. Shared by the three senders below. |
| `SMTP_HELLO_USER`, `SMTP_HELLO_PASSWORD` | Yes (email) | `hello.aitathastu@gmail.com` + its app password. Sends magic links. (`SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASSWORD` are still read as a fallback.) |
| `SMTP_INFO_USER`, `SMTP_INFO_PASSWORD` | Yes (email) | `info.aitathastu@gmail.com`. Sends welcome, resume ready and resume failed. |
| `SMTP_SUPPORT_USER`, `SMTP_SUPPORT_PASSWORD` | Yes (email) | `support.aitathastu@gmail.com`. Sends connector alerts; also the Reply-To on every other email. |
| `AUTH_EMAIL_FROM` | With email | `AI Tathastu <hello.aitathastu@gmail.com>`; must be the hello address (Gmail rewrites any other From). |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | No | When set, magic links go through Resend instead of SMTP (needs a verified domain). |
| `INTEGRATION_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` | For Collaborate/Meet | ES256 P-256 **private** JWK as one line of JSON with a `kid` (`node scripts/integration-key.mjs`). Paste it without surrounding quotes, and mark it Sensitive. Signs the apps' 15-minute access tokens; the public half is served at `/api/integrations/jwks`. Never the test key from `e2e/support/env.ts`. |
| `INTEGRATION_JWT_PREVIOUS_PUBLIC_KEYS` | During a rotation only | JSON array of retired **public** JWKs (no `d`), kept in the JWKS so live tokens still verify. See "Rotating the signing key". |
| `INTEGRATION_COLLABORATE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `INTEGRATION_MEET_CLIENT_SECRET` | For each app | `openssl rand -base64 32`. Give each app its own; an app without one can't sign users in. |
| `INTEGRATION_<APP>_REDIRECT_URIS` | Recommended | Exact callback URLs, comma-separated. Unset: any https path on the app's origin. |
| `INTEGRATION_<APP>_WEBHOOK_URL`, `INTEGRATION_<APP>_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | For push sync | Where `profile.updated` / `integration.revoked` go, and the HMAC secret the app verifies them with. |
| `CRON_SECRET` | With webhooks | At least 16 characters. Vercel Cron sends it as `Authorization: Bearer` to `/api/internal/webhooks/dispatch` daily (`vercel.json`). That sweep retries due webhooks and purges spent sign-in codes. |
| `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` | Yes (worker emails) | `openssl rand -base64 48`. **Same value on Render.** The worker uses it to call `/api/internal/notify`. |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET` | Yes (uploads) | R2 API token with Object Read & Write on this bucket. When unset, the resume step offers Skip only. |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | For the GitHub connector | GitHub OAuth App. Callback `https://www.aitathastu.com/api/connectors/github/callback`. |
| `ORCID_CLIENT_ID`, `ORCID_CLIENT_SECRET` | For faculty ORCID | Public API client from orcid.org/developer-tools, redirect URI `https://www.aitathastu.com/api/connectors/orcid/callback`. Without them the ORCID card says it isn't set up. `ORCID_BASE_URL=https://sandbox.orcid.org` for testing. |
| `ADMIN_EMAILS` | No | Comma-separated emails that can open `/admin` (default `720anant@gmail.com`). `users.is_admin = true` also grants it (takes effect at the user's next sign-in). |
| `CONNECTOR_TOKEN_KEY` | Yes | `openssl rand -base64 32`. **Same value on Render.** Encrypts connector credentials at rest; changing it makes stored connections unreadable. |
| `WORKER_WAKE_URL` | Yes on Render free | `https://ai-tathastu.onrender.com/health`. Pinged after a job is queued, to wake a sleeping worker. |
| `EMBED_JWT_SECRET` | Phase 4 embed | `openssl rand -base64 48`, at least 32 characters, different from `AUTH_SECRET`. |
| `EMBED_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Phase 4 embed | Exact pilot-site origins, comma-separated. When empty, no site can get embed tokens. |

Never set on Vercel: LLM or scraper keys (`GROQ_KEYS` and the rest below). They belong to the worker only.

### Render (worker)

Dashboard → the service → Environment. `render.yaml` lists these with `sync: false`.

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WORKER_DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Neon **direct** URL (no `-pooler`): a long-lived connection for `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. Falls back to `DATABASE_URL`. |
| `CONNECTOR_TOKEN_KEY` | Yes | Same value as Vercel. |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET` | Yes | Reads uploaded resumes. |
| `GROQ_KEYS` | Yes (AI extraction) | Comma-separated key pool; first in the text chain. |
| `GEMINI_KEYS` | Recommended | Text fallback and the primary vision model for scanned or designed PDFs. |
| `OPENROUTER_KEYS` | Recommended | Last-resort text and vision fallback. |
| `GROQ_MODELS`, `GEMINI_MODELS`, `OPENROUTER_MODELS`, `OPENROUTER_VISION_MODELS` | No | Model overrides (`model[:strict\|json]`, tried in order). Defaults are in `worker/provider_router.py`. |
| `APIFY_TOKENS` | LinkedIn scrape | Apify token pool. `APIFY_LINKEDIN_ACTOR` overrides the actor (default `harvestapi~linkedin-profile-scraper`). |
| `FIRECRAWL_KEYS` | Portfolio connector | Firecrawl key pool. |
| `KAGGLE_KEYS` | No | `username:key`, used only by `worker/benchmark_kaggle.py`. The Kaggle connector uses each user's own key. |
| `STACK_EXCHANGE_KEY` | No | Raises the Stack Exchange quota; the connector works without it. |
| `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` | Yes (emails, webhooks) | Same value as Vercel. Without it the worker sends no emails and recomputed profiles don't reach Collaborate/Meet. |
| `APP_URL` | No | Default `https://www.aitathastu.com`; where the worker sends notification requests. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | Default `INFO`. |
| `WORKER_ID`, `WORKER_LOCK_SECONDS` | No | Defaults `host:pid` and `300`. |

Render sets `PORT` itself. Never put SMTP credentials on Render: free web services can't open outbound SMTP connections (ports 25, 465 and 587 are blocked), so the worker asks the web app to send its emails. Without AI keys, or without the user's `external_ai` consent, extraction still runs but is rules-only.

### Local development

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. The web app and the worker both read it (the worker from `../.env.local`). Fill in what you need from both tables above. Use the direct Neon URL for `WORKER_DATABASE_URL`, and leave `WORKER_WAKE_URL` empty when running the worker yourself.

Local-only options:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL=postgres://…@localhost…` | A localhost URL makes the app use node-postgres instead of Neon (e.g. Postgres in Docker). |
| `R2_ENDPOINT` | Any S3-compatible endpoint (MinIO) instead of R2. |
| `WORKER_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` | The worker reads `<dir>/<storage_key>` instead of R2. |

The E2E sets its own environment (`e2e/support/env.ts`) and needs nothing from `.env.local`.

## Commands

### Migrations

Generate a migration after changing `src/db/schema.ts`, review the SQL in `src/db/migrations/`, commit it, then apply it **before** deploying code that needs it:

```bash
npm run db:generate          # schema.ts → new SQL migration
npm run db:migrate:http      # apply pending migrations over HTTPS (Neon serverless driver)
npm run db:migrate           # same via drizzle-kit over TCP 5432, where that port isn't blocked
```

Both use `DATABASE_URL` from `.env.local` (or the environment), so check it points at the database you mean. Applied migrations are recorded in `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`; re-running is a no-op.

### Feature flags (Phase 4)

```bash
npm run flags                          # list
npm run flags -- on pilot_site_embed   # enable; takes effect on the next request, no deploy
npm run flags -- off avasar_profile_api
```

### Worker, locally

```bash
cd worker
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py      # what Render runs: /health on $PORT + the queue loop
python worker.py      # queue loop only
pip install pytest && pytest -q   # unit tests (no DB, no network)
```

Scanned PDFs need Tesseract on the host (`brew install tesseract`).

### Tests

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test                          # Vitest
npx playwright install chromium   # once per machine (locally it can use installed Chrome)
npm run test:e2e                  # full Phase 1–3 journey against a throwaway stack
```

### Integrations (Collaborate, Tathastu Meet)

Guide for the apps' developers: [docs/integration-guide.md](docs/integration-guide.md). To switch one on:

1. Set `INTEGRATION_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` once, and the app's `INTEGRATION_<APP>_*` variables on Vercel; redeploy.
2. Give the app's team its client secret and webhook secret through a secret manager.
3. `npm run flags -- on collaborate_profile_api` (or `meet_profile_api`).

Users manage what each app sees at `/settings/integrations`. Every optional scope starts off; scopes the app asks for are labelled "Requested by <app>".

Registered for Collaborate (`client_id` `collaborate`):

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `INTEGRATION_COLLABORATE_REDIRECT_URIS` | `https://collaborate.aitathastu.com/api/auth/tathastu/callback` (comma-separated list of exact URLs; no JSON, no quotes) |
| `INTEGRATION_COLLABORATE_WEBHOOK_URL` | `https://collaborate.aitathastu.com/api/webhooks/tathastu` (single URL) |
| Events | `profile.updated`, `integration.revoked` |
| Scopes | `skills`, `projects`, `eris`, `experience`, `education`, `achievements`, `activity`, all opt-in per user |

#### Checking the configuration without revealing it

```bash
npm run integrations:check            # .env.local
npm run integrations:check -- --remote   # the deployed app (GET /api/internal/integrations/status, Bearer INTERNAL_API_SECRET)
```

Both print, per variable: present or missing, format problems, and an 8-character SHA-256 **fingerprint** for shared secrets. To confirm two systems hold the same secret (Vercel and Render's `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`, or our client secret and Collaborate's), compare fingerprints, never values. On the other side, the fingerprint is `printf %s "$VALUE" | shasum -a 256 | cut -c1-8`.

#### Rotating the signing key (no downtime)

1. Generate a new key with `node scripts/integration-key.mjs`. It gets a new `kid`.
2. Put the **old** key's public part (its `kty`, `crv`, `x`, `y`, `kid`, without `d`) in `INTEGRATION_JWT_PREVIOUS_PUBLIC_KEYS` as a JSON array, set `INTEGRATION_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` to the new key, and redeploy. The JWKS now publishes both keys, and new tokens use the new `kid`.
3. After at least 1 hour (the JWKS cache time, which is longer than the 15-minute token life), remove `INTEGRATION_JWT_PREVIOUS_PUBLIC_KEYS` and redeploy.

The apps need no change, because they select keys by `kid`.

#### Rotating an app's client or webhook secret (coordinated)

The token exchange and webhook signatures check exactly one secret per app, so each rotation is a short coordinated switch. Agree a time with the app's team first.

- **Client secret:**
  1. Set the new `INTEGRATION_<APP>_CLIENT_SECRET` on Vercel without redeploying yet.
  2. The app team stages the same value.
  3. At the agreed time, redeploy here and deploy there.
  4. Sign-ins that fail in the gap can simply be retried.
  5. Confirm by comparing fingerprints with `--remote`.
- **Webhook secret:** same procedure. Webhooks that fail in the gap are retried automatically (outbox backoff: 1 min, then 5 min, 30 min, 2 h and 12 h).
- **Never rotate one side alone.** If a secret leaks, rotate immediately and accept a few minutes of failed sign-ins over leaving it valid.

### Email previews

```bash
npm run email:test                  # every template, from its real sender, to 720anant@gmail.com
npm run email:test -- you@example.com
```

Uses the `SMTP_*` credentials in `.env.local` and exits 1 if any send fails. Templates are in `src/lib/email/templates.ts`; senders in `src/lib/email.ts`.

### Verify Phase 2 output for a user

```bash
npm run verify:phase2 -- <user-id | email>
```

This is read-only. It checks that the user has a `profile_views` row with at least 3 widgets, skills (through `skill_evidence`) and `eris_scores` rows. It exits 1 if any check fails. Run it after a user finishes onboarding and the worker has processed `compute_intelligence`.

---

## Release checklist

1. CI is green on the commit.
2. Pending migrations are applied to Neon (`npm run db:migrate:http`).
3. Vercel and Render variables match the tables above. `CONNECTOR_TOKEN_KEY` is the same on both.
4. The R2 bucket CORS rule allows `PUT` from `https://www.aitathastu.com` (see README, "R2 bucket CORS").
5. OAuth redirect and callback URLs are registered for the production domain (Google, LinkedIn, GitHub).
6. After deploy, open `https://ai-tathastu.onrender.com/health` and get `200`.
7. Smoke test: `/login` loads; an unauthenticated `GET /api/profile/v1/me` returns `401`.
8. Sign up a test account, finish onboarding, and run `npm run verify:phase2 -- <email>`.

Before public launch, rotate every credential that has ever been shared outside the secret stores: Neon password, R2 keys, Gmail app password, `AUTH_SECRET`, OAuth client secrets, and API tokens. Rotating `CONNECTOR_TOKEN_KEY` means users must reconnect their sources.
