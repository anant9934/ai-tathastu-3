"""Student ↔ mentor matching (compute_matches). Pure scoring; I/O is in
intelligence/matches.py.

Alumni → student: the alum's current role (company, job title, closest area)
against the student's target roles, boosted when they went to the same
university (normalized institution_id) and when the alum offers referrals.

Faculty → student: research interests against the student's skills, the same
specialization (specialization_id), and the directions the faculty member
mentors in. Faculty with no mentoring capacity aren't matched.

Each pair gets a 0–1 score and short reasons shown on the dashboards.
