 * Wakes the worker after a job is queued. On Render's free tier the worker
 * sleeps after ~15 min without HTTP traffic; any request wakes it (a cold
 * start takes up to about a minute), and it then drains the queue.
 *
 * Non-blocking: runs via after(), once the response has been sent (Vercel
 * keeps the function alive for it). The job is already safe in Postgres, so a
 * failed ping only delays processing until the next one. No-op without
 * WORKER_WAKE_URL. Call only from Server Actions / Route Handlers.
